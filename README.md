add magic system
remove the updatestats per step, should not need to take a step to update stats after equipping/unequipping
User Story: When I find and beat the boss, I win.
might be altering state in action creators
credit sounds
use map for loops and create more components like for attribute
remove bootstrap





refactoring
..............
constants - do not have to be from another file
each component/container has its own scss file

strength*		melee dmg*	tiny life*
agility	    	tiny damage*	dodge chance*

1	next attack does 25% more damage

Should I check if action can go through before action function call or in action creator?
Should I calculate in action creators and only pass new values in reducers?
